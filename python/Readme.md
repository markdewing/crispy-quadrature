## Implementations in Python

The implementations are intended to have a range of complexity
   * Basic trapezoidal rule to more complex schemes
   * One dimension -> two dimensions -> N dimensions

Codes
* trap1.py  - Basic trapezoidal rule in one dimension
* trap1_cc.py - Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature on an infinite interval in one dimension.  Based on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clenshaw%E2%80%93Curtis_quadrature
* tanh_sinh.py - Tanh-sinh quadrature in one dimension.  Based on https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15057
