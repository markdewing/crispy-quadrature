Multidimensional quadrature is hard. Computers are fast. Let's see who wins.


### Useful other codes

* https://github.com/nschloe/quadpy   Collection of numerical integrations schemes in Python.
* https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/  Collection of codes for a number of algorithms, including quadrature.  Implementations are sometimes in multiple languages (Fortran 77/90, C, C++, Python, Matlab).  There is no grouping by subject, but individual pages have a "Related Data and Programs" section for browsing.
